# SquadCreationBlocker Plugin for SquadJS

## Description

The SquadCreationBlocker plugin is designed for SquadJS to manage and control squad creation in Squad servers. It prevents squads from being created within a specified time after a new game starts and at the end of a round. It offers two modes of operation: broadcasting countdown messages or sending individual warnings to players attempting to create squads.

## Features

- Blocks squad creation for a configurable duration at the start of each new game.
- Prevents squad creation at the end of a round.
- Two modes of operation: broadcast mode and warning mode.
- Configurable block duration.
- Option to allow default squad names during the blocked period.
- Provides feedback to players attempting to create squads during blocked periods.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [SquadJS](https://github.com/Team-Silver-Sphere/SquadJS) installed and configured.
2. Place the `squad-creation-blocker.js` file in your SquadJS plugins directory.
3. Update your SquadJS configuration file to include the SquadCreationBlocker plugin.

## Configuration

Add the following to your SquadJS configuration file:

```json
{
  "plugin": "SquadCreationBlocker",
  "enabled": true,
  "blockDuration": 15,
  "broadcastMode": false,
  "allowDefaultSquadNames": true,
  "rateLimitEnforced": false,
  "rateLimitWindow": 2,
  "rateLimitMaxSquads": 3,
  "rateLimitBackoffTime": 10,
  "maxSquadsInTimeWindow": 10,
  "timeWindowForKick": 5,
  "enforceMaxSquadCreationKick": false
}
```

### Options

- `enabled`: Set to `true` to enable the plugin, `false` to disable.
- `blockDuration`: The duration (in seconds) after a new game starts during which squad creation is blocked. Default is 15 seconds.
- `broadcastMode`: Set to `true` to enable countdown broadcasts, `false` to enable individual warnings. Default is false.
- `allowDefaultSquadNames`: Set to `true` to allow creation of squads with default names (e.g., "Squad 1") during the blocking period. Default is true.
- `rateLimitEnforced` : Set to `true` to enable rate limiting on custom squad creation, `false` to disable rate limiting. Default is false.
- `rateLimitWindow` : The time window (in seconds) within which a player can create a maximum number of custom squads before triggering the backoff. Default is 2 seconds.
- `rateLimitMaxSquads` : The maximum number of custom squads a player can create within the rateLimitWindow before triggering the backoff. Default is 3 squads.
- `rateLimitBackoffTime` : The time (in seconds) a player must wait after exceeding the rate limit before being allowed to create another custom squad. Default is 10 seconds.
- `maxSquadsInTimeWindow`: The maximum number of squads a player can create within the defined time window before being kicked. Default is 10 squads.
- `timeWindowForKick`: The time window (in seconds) during which squad creation will be tracked for kicking players. Default is 5 seconds.
- `enforceMaxSquadCreationKick`: Set to `true` to kick players exceeding the max squads in the time window, `false` to disable kicking. Default is false.

## Usage

Once configured and enabled, the plugin will automatically:

1. Block squad creation for the specified duration at the start of each new game.
2. Prevent squad creation at the end of each round.
3. If `broadcastMode` is set to `true`:
   - Broadcast countdown messages at multiples of 10 seconds.
   - Broadcast a message when squad creation is unlocked.
4. If `broadcastMode` is set to `false`:
   - Send individual warnings to players attempting to create squads during the blocked period.
5. Disband any squads created during the blocked period.
6. Allow creation of squads with default names during the blocked period if `allowDefaultSquadNames` is set to `true`.
7. Rate Limiting (if `rateLimitEnforced` is set to true)
    - Track the number of custom squads a player creates within the specified `rateLimitWindow`.
    - Trigger a backoff period if a player exceeds the `rateLimitMaxSquads` within that window.
8. Max Squad Creation Kick (if `enforceMaxSquadCreationKick` is set to true)
    - Monitor squad creation attempts and kick players who exceed `maxSquadsInTimeWindow` within the defined `timeWindowForKick`.

## Behavior

- **New Game Start**: 
  - Blocks squad creation for the specified `blockDuration`.
  - If in broadcast mode, schedules countdown broadcasts.
  - When the block period ends, allows squad creation and broadcasts an "unlocked" message.

- **Round End**: 
  - Blocks squad creation indefinitely until the next game starts.
  - Cancels any scheduled broadcasts.

- **Squad Creation Attempt During Blocked Period**:
  - If the squad name is custom:
    - Disbands the squad immediately.
    - If in warning mode:
      - During new game block: Informs how many seconds remain before they can create a custom squad.
      - During round end: Informs that custom squad creation is not allowed at the end of a round.
  - If the squad name is default (e.g., "Squad 1") and `allowDefaultSquadNames` is true:
    - Allows the squad to be created.

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - If `rateLimitEnforced` is enabled:
    - Tracks squad creation attempts within the `rateLimitWindow`.
    - If a player exceeds the `rateLimitMaxSquads`, they enter a backoff period defined by `rateLimitBackoffTime`.

- **Max Squad Creation Kick**:
  - If `enforceMaxSquadCreationKick` is enabled:
    - Monitors squad creation within the `timeWindowForKick`.
    - Kicks players who create more than `maxSquadsInTimeWindow` within that time frame, with a kick message informing them of the violation.
